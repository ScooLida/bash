# Don-Hare Analysis Pipelines

The repository contains two independent analysis lines for hare genomic data.
The population-genetic line produces filtered VCF files, PCA, and ADMIXTURE
results. The BUSCO line extracts BUSCO gene sequences, filters and aligns them,
and builds gene and species trees.

The samples `1k`, `3k`, `4k`, and `5kS8` are ancient samples. Modern-only and
all-sample datasets are processed separately. Locus selection for the tree
analysis is performed using modern samples only; ancient sequences are then
added to the same modern-selected loci.

## Line 1: VCF and Population Analyses

Run the scripts in this order:

### `scr_11_bam_to_vcf.sh`

Calls variants from Paleomix BAM files, restricts variant calling to regions
listed in `chr.txt`, and merges per-sample VCF files. Modern samples then define
the filtered variant positions. The all-sample VCF is restricted to exactly the
same positions, while ancient samples with no call remain missing (`./.`).

Filters: `QUAL >= 20` and `MIN(FMT/DP) >= 3`.

### `scr_12_pca_admixture.sh`

Runs PCA for modern and all-sample datasets using the modern-selected
positions. PLINK applies `--geno 0.2` only to modern samples. ADMIXTURE tests
`K=2..15` on modern samples, selects the lowest cross-validation error, and
then uses projection mode (`-P`) for all samples. The modern `.P` matrix is
fixed, so ancient samples receive ancestry proportions without re-estimating
the modern model. Ancient-only results are saved to
`population_analysis/ancient_projection_K<K>.tsv`.

### `scr_13_population_plots.R`

Creates PCA scatter plots and ADMIXTURE ancestry-proportion plots for both
datasets using the outputs from `scr_12_pca_admixture.sh`.

### `scr_14_dsuite.sh`

Runs `Dsuite Dtrios` on `MyHare_with_all_samples.vcf.gz` using both
`for_data/sets_hare.txt` and `for_data/sets_krol.txt`. The set files define the
population/species assignments and outgroup; samples marked `xxx` are ignored
by Dsuite. Results are written to `dsuite_results/sets_hare_*` and
`dsuite_results/sets_krol_*`.

## Line 2: BUSCO Gene Analysis and Trees

Run the scripts in this order:

### `scr_21_bam_to_busco.sh`

Extracts BUSCO gene loci from BAM files and prepares two merged FASTA datasets:
one containing modern samples only, and one containing modern plus ancient
samples. Existing per-sample FASTA files are skipped when they are non-empty
and contain more than `MIN_SEQ_LENGTH` nucleotides.

Filters and settings: `MIN_COVERAGE=2`, discard sequences shorter than
`MIN_SEQ_LENGTH=10`, and use BUSCO coordinates from `BED_FILE`.

### `scr_22_mafft.sh`

Aligns modern FASTA files first with MAFFT using nine parallel jobs, then adds
ancient sequences to the modern alignments with `mafft --addfragments`. This
preserves the modern alignment as the backbone. If an ancient sample has no
sequence for a selected locus, the all-sample alignment contains an `N` sequence
of the same length as the modern alignment. Loci without any modern sequence
are skipped because they cannot define the modern backbone. Modern input
sequences longer than 5000 nt are rejected before MAFFT. An alignment that
exceeds 5000 nt after MAFFT is handled by the later `scr_23` filter. Completed
modern alignments are reused when the script is restarted. The number of
parallel jobs can be supplied at launch, for example `bash scr_22_mafft.sh 2`;
the default is `9`.

### `scr_23_filter_by_gaps.sh`

Filters aligned BUSCO genes using the modern alignments only and writes the
modern-selected locus list. The same list is copied for the all-sample dataset;
absence of an ancient sequence does not remove the locus.

Filters: maximum sequence length `5000`, minimum ATGC count per modern sample
`30`, and maximum non-ATGC proportion `30%`.

### `scr_24_iqtree_astral.sh`

Builds the modern-only IQ-TREE gene trees first with the `GTR+G` model and runs
ASTRAL to produce the modern backbone species tree. It then builds a second set
of gene trees and an all-sample species tree using the same modern-selected
loci after ancient sequences have been added. The second tree is a combined
inference and may change the topology; it is not formal fixed-tree placement.

## Other Files

### `scr_98_sex.sh`

An independent sex-analysis script based on X-chromosome and autosomal
coverage. BAM filtering and indexing commands are currently commented out and
must be enabled or revised before use.

### `scr_99_old_ngs_analysis`

Archived older analysis material; it is not part of the two main workflows.
